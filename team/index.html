				Hey guys, I'm James Wolff one of the developers for PCMRBot. I work on both the bot and the website. You will see me making commits to the <a href="http://github.com/jwolff52/PCMRBot/">github</a> quite often, but that's just because this is essentially my full-time, unpaid job.
				I started with HTML/CSS when I was 10 and picked up JavaScript and PHP a few years later. I didn't make amazing things back then and I still don't to this day, I much prefer Java, but I find Web Development to be lot of fun too!
				I started my "adventures" with Java a couple years back when I took my first (and only) programming class. We didn't really even get through all of the curriculum that we were supposed to, but it was enough to get me hooked. Since then I've built one (unfinished) application and several CraftBukkit Plugins, almost all of which are on my <a href="http://github.com/jwolff52">github</a>.</p>

				My name is Logan Saso. I work primarily with bot. I am a junior in High School taking an AP Level Computer Science Class that deals with Java. I had previous experience with programming from summer camps and what I read independently.
				This is probably the first program that I have written that doesnâ€™t just achieve an assignment. This was purely free form. I decided to make this project as something that would expand my knowledge and possible be fun over the break.
				The original idea was for users to type a command that would change the screens on my OBS because a friend and I were streaming at the same time. What he would do is stream to a local server on my computer and I would use VLC and OBS to stream it.
				Then it got to a point that we had added so many commands we thought it might be fun to upload it to a dedicated server. At the time it was only Kyle and I working on it but we found James soon after and the project just blew up from there.</p>

				<h2>Kyle Nabinger</h2>
				<p><a href="http://twitch.tv/angablade"><img class="img-odd" src="../media/tyler.jpg" alt="Kyle Nadinger" /></a>
				I've been programming for a long time now. I've done work in ASM for the Playstation and Playstation2 back when they were a thing. Transferred over to writing computer applications for fun. Worked with DirectX and OpenGL for a while before I moved on to more practical projects.
				I then started to get into web development for a while and learned all the necessities along the way (PHP, JavaScript, JQuery/Ajax, CSS:actions). I never really <i>learned</i> Java, I just tried and it worked out... kinda.. I based most of my code off of C when working with Java, as it seems the most alike.
				I seem like the most experienced here, but I'm not nothing with Java. I met the other devs for the projects while trolling the /programming section on twitch, as I like to help those who are struggling with a project they are working on, and I just never left.
				This thing got bigger and bigger, and I don't think I would be allowed to leave without them trying to kill me for it. Nevertheless, this bio is boring. I'm done typing, now please leave me be.</p>
